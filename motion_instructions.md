# PMoC3D – Motion Instructions Log
This log records the head-motion events performed by each subject while acquiring the **PMoC3D**  dataset.

## 1  General protocol

* **Nominal scan time**   ≈ 2 min 40 s (160 s) per volume

* **Cueing**   The operator used the **time‑remaining** counter on the console to instruct the participant.

* **Timing notation**   Events are logged as **time‑remaining (mm\:ss)**.

## 2  Event log

Fill in or edit the tables below so they reflect the exact protocol that was used during acquisition.
*If a scan had **no intentional motion**, simply write “None”.*
